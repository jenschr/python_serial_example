# Python serial examples
Very basic example for Serial communication on Raspberry Pi and other Python-centric platforms. I used this to test RS485 tranceivers when talking to other hardware from a Raspberry Pi. Feel free to use this as you like, but be sure to select the correct Serial ports and settings or it won't work.
